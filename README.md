# SNS_21-22_SN18051000
* This is a repository for the final assignment of ELEC0088, created by student 18051000. <br>
* The program is able to build a machine learning model to perform time series predictions. <br>
* The dataset being used is the Sunspots dataset which contains the numbers of sunspots in 235 years (1749 to 1983). <br>
* The whole program is written in Python. <br>

## Main tasks that are achieved:
#### 1. MLP model for future predictions: <br>
   .... <br>
#### 2. Chatbot processing of sentences from the user: <br>
   .... <br>

## Organisation of files and their roles:

#### 1. `README.md`: <br>



## The necessary Python packages/modules are: <br>
